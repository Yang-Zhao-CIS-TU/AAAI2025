Boosting ViT-based MRI Reconstruction from the Perspectives of Frequency Modulation, Spatial Purification, and Scale Diversification
"FPS-Former", is a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework designed to improve accelerated MRI reconstruction by addressing three key limitations of existing ViT-based approaches:

(1) Enhancing High-Frequency Information: ViTs struggle with capturing fine textures and edges. To address this, FPS-Former introduces a Frequency Modulation Attention Module that adaptively re-calibrates frequency components using a Laplacian pyramid.

(2) Reducing Computational Redundancy: Standard multi-head self-attention (MSA) in ViTs processes both relevant and irrelevant tokens, introducing noise and increasing computational costs. FPS-Former proposes a Spatial Purification Attention Module to refine attention by focusing only on closely related tokens.

(3) Improving Multi-Scale Feature Representation: The naive feed-forward network (FFN) in ViTs lacks the ability to capture multi-scale information. FPS-Former integrates a Hybrid-Scale Fusion Strategy in the FFN to enhance feature learning across different scales.

2. Conditioning of Score-Based Diffusion Models by Neuro-Symbolic Constraints: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16534

code: https://github.com/DavideScassola/score-based-constrained-generation
It enables conditional sampling from a pre-trained unconditional score-based generative model under arbitrary logical constraints, without requiring additional training. Unlike other zero-shot techniques that focus on generating valid conditional samples, this approach aims to approximate the true conditional distribution.

(1) Score Manipulation for Conditional Sampling: The method modifies the learned score function to sample from an unnormalized conditional distribution based on user-defined constraints.

(2) Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Constraints: A flexible and numerically stable approach is introduced to encode soft logical constraints.

(3) Heuristic Refinements: Additional heuristics improve the accuracy of the approximation.

(4) Broad Applicability: The method is evaluated across tabular data, images, and time series, demonstrating its effectiveness in approximating various conditional distributions.
