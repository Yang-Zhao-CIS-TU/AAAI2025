1. Bridging Sequence-Structure Alignment in RNA Foundation Models

OmniGenome, is an RNA foundation model (FM) designed to establish strong alignment between RNA sequences and secondary structures, enabling bidirectional mappings between them.

(1) Structure-Contextualized RNA Modelling: OmniGenome integrates sequence-structure alignment, allowing flexible input/output modalities (sequence-to-structure and structure-to-sequence transformations).
(2) Versatile Applications: Demonstrates effectiveness in RNA design and zero-shot secondary structure prediction, achieving superior Seq2Str and Str2Seq mapping capabilities.
(3) State-of-the-Art Performance:
Solved 74% of puzzles on the EternaV2 benchmark, far surpassing existing models (â‰¤3%).
Achieved leading performance across RNA and DNA benchmarks, even without explicit DNA genome training.
(4) Improved Genomic Information Flow: Enables seamless interaction between RNA sequences and structures, addressing a critical limitation in existing RNA foundation models.
